# ImageClassificationML
A machine learning project for image classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and CNN.

# Image Classification ML Project

## Overview

This project implements various machine learning models for image classification, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The models are trained and evaluated using a dataset of images organized in a directory structure.

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized into subdirectories, where each subdirectory represents a different class. For example:
